#  Simple Metadata Site Configuration
Simple Metadata will create Front Page box with Site Type options in Simple Metadata settings page.

## Front Page
Type of Site have two options which allow the configuration of the metadata. Pick the one that describes better the Site :
* Blog (Selected by default)
* WebSite

Full description of site types and properties are available [here](/doc/doc-metadata-site.md).

NOTE: In a PressBooks installation, Book type is the only possibility and is activated by default. In a regular WP installation, Book is just possible with Simple Metadata Education.
