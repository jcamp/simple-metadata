# Site metadata

Simple Metadata will create Front Page box with Site Type options in Simple Metadata [settings](/doc-settings-site.md) page.

## Settings

The top 'types' for the description of the Site, Blog (Selected by default) and WebSite, (which are subtypes of Creative Work).

Full description of site types and properties are available [here](/doc/doc-metadata-site.md).

NOTE: In a PressBooks installation, types are not available besides Book, which is activated by default. In a regular WP installation, Book is just possible with Simple Metadata Education.

_No further configuration is necessary, all the properties find the values from WordPress._

# Post types and properties

Blog and WebSite inherits properties from both parent types (Thing and CreativeWork).

The Site can be identified by a collection of 4 schema.org [Properties](/doc/doc-metadata-post.md).

SM just offer properties from WordPress core fields. If you woud like to extend those poroperties, you must activate one of the Simple Metadata addons.
